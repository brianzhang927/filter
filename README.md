# Filter
This program is a filtering tool that applies different filters (grayscale, sepia, reflection, blur) to bitmap image files. This program was created to accompany my studies of memory in computer science.

### Motivation
This was motivated by Harvard's CS50 and partly includes their distribution code and images.

### Usage
Usage: ./filter -[g,r,s,b] infile.bmp outfile.bmp
